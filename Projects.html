        My company’s technology is not invented or implement in today’s society. Full dive virtual technology doesn’t exist because we haven’t figured out how to transfer the signals in the brain to a complete digital world. The closest we’ve come is in 2015 at the University of California a paralyzed man walk with just his thoughts Novel brain-computer interface technology created by University of California, Irvine researchers has allowed a paraplegic man to walk for a short distance. In the preliminary proof-of-concept study, led by UCI biomedical engineer Zoran Nenadic and neurologist An Do, a person with complete paralysis in both legs due to spinal cord injury was able, for the first time, to take steps without relying on manually controlled robotic limbs. The male participant, whose legs had been paralyzed for five years, walked along a 12-foot course using an electroencephalogram-based system that lets the brain bypass the spinal cord to send messages to the legs (UCI News, 2015). My thought is using the same electrical symbols and figure out how to turn them into code for the game to display everything your brain is doing. We may have to cooperate with researchers to develop this technology and with the use of Electroencephalography we may have to hire technicians and medical personnel.

        My product offers amazing outcome of human innovation. The new full dive virtual reality has never been done and we are working to create the first of its kind. Imagine just throwing on a battery powered wireless headset that takes our whole subconscious to beautiful virtual world full of wonder. From adventure games to beautiful nature walks and scenery all at the push of a button. This haste works through taking your brainwaves and putting them into an Electroencephalograph then converting those Electroencephalograph signals into lines of code that make up your characters actions in the virtual world basically transferring your thoughts to your avatar making it seem like your actually there.
