        At Full Dive Inc. we are developing full neural virtual reality. This product will take brain waves and funnel them into code so you can hear, feel, smell, and taste in a virtual world. The virtual world will also communicate with your brain to send it the data required for all 5 senses. This will be a feat that mankind hasnâ€™t accomplished and be a completely new technology. The technology is a wireless headset the charges in the wall. You can just lay on your bed and activate it.  After saying certain commands, the headset turns on while your brain waves are read your body goes to sleep while the virtual world is a dream but you can play through and completely control. In the future once this product is developed, we hope to start making games for the product where you can play and met online with other people in these virtual worlds. This new technology has never been done and puts us way ahead on the gaming and technological frontier. It will give us a completely new platform to try. Not only will this be available for the gaming industry it may have many other uses such as medical uses. We have many routes we can go that competitively put us in front of other companies. We will be filing both a design and utility patent for our product.
